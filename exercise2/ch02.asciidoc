== The Kotlin Collections Framework

In the preceding chapter we offered an overview of the syntax of
the Kotlin language.  As with any language, syntax is a
foundation but, really, no more than that.  When it comes to
getting actual work done, syntax alone won't carry the
water.  To do that you need expressions and idioms that are
easy to assemble into useful code, and that are as easy for
other developers to understand and modify.

One important aspect of nearly every modern language is its
_collections framework_: ways of grouping objects, and
libraries of functions that manipulate them.

At the time it was introduced, Java's collection framework
was state of the art. Today, more than 20 years later, the
basic data structures provided by newer languages have not
changed much.  All of the containers that we're familiar with from the Java framework (or even the earliest versions of the C++
`stdlib`) are still there: `Iterable`, [.keep-together]#`Collection`,# `List`,
`Set`, and `Map` (to use their Java names). In response to
broad acceptance of functional styles of programming,
however, collections frameworks for modern languages like
Swift and Scala usually provide a set of common,
higher-order functions that operate on the collections:
`filter`, `map`, `flatmap`, `zip`, and more. You will,
indeed, find these functions in the collections framework from the Kotlin Standard Library. 

In this chapter, we will first visit the collections
themselves and a few interesting extensions that the
Kotlin language empowers. After that, we will dig into
some of the powerful higher-order functions that
operate on the collections.

=== Collection Basics

Kotlin's collections framework embeds the data structures
from the Java Collections Framework as a subset.  It wraps the
basic Java classes with some new features and adds
functional transformations that operate on them.

Let's start this deep dive into the collections library with
a quick look at some of the extensions to the data
structures themselves.

==== Java Interoperability

Because seamless interoperablity with Java is a central goal of the
Kotlin language, Kotlin collection data types are based on their
Java counterparts. <<kotlin_collections>> illustrates the
relationship.

.The Kotlin collection type hierarchy and its relation to Java.
image::images/pawk_0201.jpg["Kotlin Collections"]

By making Kotlin  collection types subtypes of their Java analogs,
Kotlin preserves all of functionality of the Java Collections
Framework. For the most part, Kotlin extends, but does not alter the
Java framework.  It just adds the new, functional methods.

There is one significant exception:
mutability.

==== Mutability

It is, perhaps, only logical that a language that embeds mutability in its syntax would also embed mutability in its
collection system.



Kotlin defines two distinct type hierarchies in its
collections framework, one for collections that are mutable
and one for collections that are not. This can be seen in <<mutability_in_collections>>. 

[[mutability_in_collections]]
.Mutable and Immutable Lists
====
[source,kotlin]
----
val mutableList = mutableListOf(1, 2, 4, 5)
val immutableList = listOf(1, 2, 4, 5)
mutableList.add(4)    // compiles

// doesn't compile: ImmutableList has no `add` method.
immutableList.add(2)
----
====

[NOTE]
====
_Mutable_ is the opposite of _immutable_. A mutable object
can be changed and an immutable one cannot. The distinction
is critical when trying to optimize code. Since they cannot
change, immutable objects can be shared safely among multiple
threads. A mutable object, however, must be made explicitly
thread-safe if it is to be shared. Thread safety requires
locking or copying, which may be expensive.
====

Unfortunately, Kotlin cannot guarantee the immutablity of
its immutable collections. Immutable collections simply do
not have mutator functions (`add`, `remove`, `put`, etc.).
Especially when a Kotlin collection is passed to Java code—where Kotlin's immutability constraints are not enforced by
the type system—there can be no assurance that the contents
of the collection will not change.

Note that the mutability of a collection is not related to
the mutability of the object that the collection contains.
As a very simple example, consider the following code:

[source,kotlin]
----
val deeplist = listOf(mutableListOf(1, 2), mutableListOf(3, 4))

// Does not compile: "Unresolved reference: add"
deeplist.add(listOf(3))

deeplist[1][1] = 5      // works
deeplist[1].add(6)      // works

----

The variable `deeplist` is a `List<MutableList<Int>>`.  It is
and always will be a list of two lists.  The contents of the
lists that `deeplist` contains, however, can grow, shrink, and change. 


The creators of Kotlin are actively investigating all things
immutable. The prototype [.keep-together]#`kotlinx.collections.immutable`# library is intended to be a set of truly immutable collections. To use them in
your own Android/Kotlin project, add the following
dependency to your `build.gradle` file:

----
implementation \ 
'org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-collections-immutable:$IC_VERSION'
----

While the _Kotlinx Immutable Collections Library_ uses
state-of-the-art algorithms and optimizes them so that they
are very fast compared to other JVM implementations [.keep-together]#of
immutable collections,# these true immutable collections are
still an order of magnitude slower than their mutable
analogs. Currently, there's nothing to be done about
it. However, many modern developers are willing to sacrifice
some performance for the safety that immutability brings,
especially in the context of [.keep-together]#concurrency#.footnote:[Roman Elizarov; email interview on Kotlin Collections Immutable Library. Oct. 8, 2020.]


==== Overloaded Operators

Kotlin supports a  disciplined ability to overload the meanings of certain infix operators, in particular, `+` and `-`. Kotlin's collections framework makes good use of this capability. To demonstrate, let's
look at a naive implementation of a function to convert
a `List<Int>` to a `List<Double>`:

[source,kotlin]
----
fun naiveConversion(intList: List<Int>): List<Double> {
    var ints = intList
    var doubles = listOf<Double>()
    while (!ints.isEmpty()) {
        val item = ints[0]
        ints = ints - item
        doubles = doubles + item.toDouble()
    }
    return doubles
}
----

Don't do this.  The only thing that this example does
efficiently is demonstrate the use of the two infix
operators `+` and `-`.  The former adds an element to a list
and the latter removes an element from it.

The operand to the
left of a `+` or `-` operator can define the behavior of that
operator. Containers, when they appear to the left of a `+`
or `-`, define two implementations for each of those two
operators: one when the right-hand operand is 
another container and the other when it is not.

Adding a noncontainer object to a container creates a new container that
has all of the elements from the left-hand operand (the
container) with the new element (the right-hand operand)
added. Adding two containers together creates a new container
that has all of the elements from both.

Similarly, subtracting an object from a container creates a
new container with all but the first occurrence of the
left-hand operand. Subtracting one container from another
produces a new container that has the elements of the left-hand
operand, with _all_ occurrences of _all_ the elements in
the right-hand operand removed.

[NOTE]
====
The `+` and `-` operators preserve order when the underlying
container is ordered.  For instance:

[source,kotlin]
----
(listOf(1, 2) + 3)
    .equals(listOf(1, 2, 3))    // true
(listOf(1, 2) + listOf(3, 4))
    .equals(listOf(1, 2, 3, 4)) // true
----
====


==== Creating Containers

Kotlin does not have a way to express container literals.
There is no syntactic way, for instance, of making a `List`
of the numbers 8, 9, and 54.  Nor is there a way of making a
`Set` of the strings "Dudley" and "Mather." Instead, there
are handy methods for creating containers that are nearly as
elegant. The code in <<mutability_in_collections>> showed two simple examples of creating lists. There are also
`...Of` methods for creating mutable and immutable lists,
sets, and maps.

Creating literal maps requires knowing a clever trick.  The
`mapOf` function takes a list of `Pairs` as its argument.
Each of the pairs provides a key (the pair's first value)
and a value (the pair's second value). Recall that Kotlin
supports an extended set of infix operators.  Among these
operators is `to`, which creates a new `Pair` with its left
operand as the first element and its right operand as the 
second element. Combine these two features and you can,
conveniently, build a `Map` like this:

[source,kotlin]
----
val map = mapOf(1 to 2, 4 to 5)
----

The type of the content of a container is expressed using a
generic syntax very similar to Java's. The type of the variable
map in the preceding code, for instance, is `Map<Int, Int>`, a container
that maps `Int` keys to their `Int` values.


The Kotlin compiler is quite clever about inferring the types of the
contents of containers created with their factory methods. Obviously
in this example:

[source,kotlin]
----
val map = mutableMapOf("Earth" to 3, "Venus" to 4)
----

the type of `map` is `MutableMap<String, Int>`.  But what about this?

[source,kotlin]
----
val list = listOf(1L, 3.14)
----

Kotlin will choose the nearest type in the type hierarchy
tree that is an ancestor of all of the elements of the
container (this type is called the _upper bound type_). In
this case it will choose `Number`, the nearest ancestor of
both `Long` and `Double`. The variable `list` has the
inferred type `List<Number>`.

We can add a `String`, though, as in the following:


[source,kotlin]
----
val list = mutablelistOf(1L, 3.14, "e")
----


The only type that is an ancestor to all of the elements, a
`Long`, a `Double`, and a `String`, [.keep-together]#is the# root of the Kotlin type hierarchy, `Any`. The type of the variable `list` is
[.keep-together]#`MutableList<Any>`.#

Once again, though, recall from <<kotlin_essentials>> that the type `Any` is not
the same as the type `Any?`. The following will not compile (assuming
the definition from the preceding example):

[source,kotlin]
----
list.add(null)  // Error: Null cannot be a value of a non-null type Any
----

In order to allow the list to contain `null`, we'd have to specify its
type explicitly:

[source,kotlin]
----
val list: MutableList<Any?> = mutablelistOf(1L, 3.14, "e")
----

We can create collections now. So, what do we do with them?

=== Functional Programming

We operate on them! Nearly all of the operations that we
will discuss here are based on the paradigm of functional
programming. In order to understand their context and
motivation, let's review the paradigm.

_Object-oriented programming_ (OOP) and _functional programming_
(FP) are both paradigms for software design. Software
architects understood the promise of functional programming
soon after its invention in the late 1950s. Early functional
programs tended to be slow, though, and it's only recently
that the functional style has been able to challenge a more
pragmatic imperative model for performance. As programs
get more complex and difficult to understand, as concurrency
becomes inevitable, and as compiler optimization improves,
functional programming is changing from a cute academic toy
into a useful tool that every developer should be able to
wield.

Functional programming encourages _immutability_.  Unlike
the functions in code, mathematical functions don't change
things.  They don't "return" anything.  They simply have a
value. Just as "4" and "2 + 2" are names for the same
number, a given function evaluated with given parameters is
simply a name (perhaps a verbose name!) for its value.
Because mathematical functions do not change, they are not
affected by time. This is immensely useful when working in
a concurrent environment.

Though different, FP and OOP paradigms can coexist. Java was,
certainly, designed as an OO language, and Kotlin, fully interoperable,
can duplicate Java algorithms nearly word for word. As we
proclaimed in the preceding chapter, though, the true power of Kotlin lies
in its extensible functional programming capabilities. It’s not
uncommon for folks to start out writing “Java in Kotlin.” As they
start to feel more comfortable, they tend to gravitate toward more
idiomatic Kotlin, and much of that involves applying the power of FP.

==== Functional Versus Procedural: A Simple Example

The following code shows a procedural way of working with a
collection:


[source,kotlin]
----
fun forAll() {
    for (x in collection) { doSomething(x) }
}
----


In the example, a `for` loop iterates over a list.  It
selects an element from `collection` and assigns it to the
variable `x`. It then calls the method `doSomething` on the
element. It does this for each element in the list.

The only constraint on the collection is that there must be
a way to fetch each of its elements exactly once.  That
capability is precisely what is encapsulated by the type
`Iterable<T>`.

The functional paradigm is certainly less complicated: no extra variables and no special syntax. Just a single method call:


[source,kotlin]
----
fun forAll() = collection.forEach(::doSomething)
----


The `forEach` method takes a function as its argument. That argument, `doSomething` in this case, is a function that
takes a single parameter of the type contained in 
[.keep-together]#`collection`.#  In other words, if `collection` is a
list of ++String++s, `doSomething` must be [.keep-together]#`doSomething(s: String)`.# If `collection` is a `Set<Freeptootsie>`, then
[.keep-together]#`doSomething`# must be `doSomething(ft: Freeptootsie)`. The
`forEach` method calls its argument (`doSomething`) with
each element in `collection` as its parameter.

This might seem like an insignificant difference. It is not. The
`forEach` method is a much better separation of concerns.

An `Iterable<T>` is stateful, ordered, and time dependent.
Anyone who has ever had to deal with a
`ConcurrentModificationException` knows it is entirely
possible that the state of an iterator may not match the
state of the collection over which it [.keep-together]#is iterating.# While
Kotlin's `forEach` operator is not completely immune to
[.keep-together]#`ConcurrentModificationException`,# those exceptions occur in
code that is actually concurrent.

More importantly, the mechanism that a collection uses to
apply a passed function to each of its elements is entirely
the business of the collection itself. In particular, there is
no intrinsic contract about the order in which the function
will be evaluated on the collection's elements.

A collection could, for instance, divide its elements into
groups. It could farm each of these groups out to a separate
processor and then reassemble the results. This approach is
particularly interesting at a time when the number of cores
in a processor is increasing rapidly. The `Iterator<T>`
contract cannot support this kind of parallel execution.

==== Functional Android

Android has a quirky history with functional programming.
Because its virtual machine has nothing to do with Java's,
improvements in the Java language have not necessarily been
available to Android developers. Some of the most important
changes in Java, including lambdas and method references,
were not supported in Android for quite a while after they
appeared in Java 8.

Although Java could compile these new features and DEX
(Android's bytecode) could even represent them (though,
perhaps, not efficiently), the Android toolchain couldn't
convert the representations of these features—the
compiled Java bytecode—into the DEX code that could be run
on an Android system.

The first attempt to fill the gap was a package called
_RetroLambda_. Other add-on library solutions followed,
sometimes with confusing rules (e.g., with the Android Gradle
Plugin [AGP] 3.0+, if you wanted to use the Java Streams API
you had to target, at a minimum, Android API 24).

All of these constraints are now gone with Kotlin on
Android.  Recent versions of the AGP will support functional
programming even on older versions of Android. You can now
use the full Kotlin collection package on any supported
platform.


=== Kotlin Transformation Functions

In this section, you will see how Kotlin brings functional capabilities to collections to provide elegant
and safe ways of manipulating them. Just as in the previous
chapter we didn't visit all of Kotlin's syntax, we will
not in this chapter attempt to visit all of Kotlin's
library functions. It isn't necessary to memorize them all. It is
essential, though, for idiomatic and effective use of Kotlin,
to get comfortable with a few key transforms and to get a
feel for how they work.

==== The Boolean Functions

A convenient set of collection functions return a `Boolean`
to indicate whether the collection has—or does not have—a given attribute. The function `any()`, for instance,
will return `true` when a collection contains at least one
element. If used with a predicate, as in `any { predicate(it) }`, `any` will return `true` if the predicate evaluates true
for any element in the collection:

[source,kotlin]
----
val nums = listOf(10, 20, 100, 5)
val isAny = nums.any()                 // true
val isAnyOdd = nums.any { it % 1 > 0 } // true
val isAnyBig = nums.any { it > 1000}   // false
----

[NOTE]
====
When a lambda takes only a single argument and the Kotlin
compiler can figure that out using type inferencing (it
usually can), you can omit the parameter declaration and use
the implicit parameter named `it`. The preceding example uses
this shortcut twice, in the definitions of the predicates to
the `any` method.
====

Another boolean function, `all { predicate }`, returns `true` only if
every element in the list matches the predicate:

[source,kotlin]
----
val nums = listOf(10, 20, 100, 5)
val isAny = nums.all { it % 1 > 0 } // false
----

The opposite of `any` is `none`. Without a predicate, `none()` returns
`true` only if there are no elements in a collection. With a predicate,
`none { predicate }` returns `true` only if the predicate evaluates to
true for none of the elements in the collection.  For example:

[source,kotlin]
----
val nums = listOf(10, 20, 100, 5)
val isAny = nums.none()              // false
val isAny4 = nums.none { it == 4 }   // true
----

==== Filter Functions

The basic `filter` function will return a new collection
containing only the elements of the original
collection that match the given predicate. In this example,
for instance, the variable `numbers` will contain a list
with the single value `100`:

[source,kotlin]
----
val nums = listOf(10, 20, 100, 5)
val numbers = nums.filter { it > 20 }
----

The `filterNot` function is the reverse.  It returns elements that do
_not_ match the predicate. In this example, for instance, the
variable `numbers` will contain three elements, 10, 20,
and 5: the elements of `nums` that are not greater than 20:

[source,kotlin]
----
val nums = listOf(10, 20, 100, 5)
val numbers = nums.filterNot { it > 20 }
----

A beautifully convenient special case of `filterNot` is the function
`filterNotNull`. It removes all of the ++null++s from a collection:

[source,kotlin]
----
val nums = listOf(null, 20, null, 5)
val numbers = nums.filterNotNull() // { 20, 5 }
----

In this example, the variable `numbers` will be a list containing two
elements, 20 and 5.

==== Map

The _map_ function applies its argument to each element
in a collection and returns a collection of the resulting values.
Note that it does not mutate the collection to which it is
applied; it returns a new, resulting, collection.

Here is the definition of the `map` function, for the `Array` type:

[source,kotlin]
----
inline fun <T, R> Array<out T>.map(transform: (T) -> R): List<R>
----

Let's unpack this.

Starting at the left, `map` is an inline function.  The "fun"
part should be clear by now.  But what about "inline."

The keyword `inline` tells the Kotlin compiler to copy the
bytecode for a function directly into the binary whenever
the method is called, instead of generating a transfer to a single
compiled version. When the number of
instructions necessary to call a function is a substantial
percentage of the total number necessary to run it, an
`inline` function makes sense as a trade-off of space for
time. Sometimes, too, it can remove the overhead of the
extra object allocation that some lambda expressions
require.

Next, `<T, R>` are the two, free, type variables used in the function
definition.  We'll get back to them.

Next is the description of the receiver, `Array<out T>`.
This `map` function is an extension function on the `Array` type: it
is a function on an array whose elements are of type `T` (or one of
++T++'s superclasses, e.g., `Any`).

Next is the ++map++'s parameter. The parameter is a function named _transform_. Transform is a function `transform: (T) -> R`: it takes as its argument something of type `T` and returns something of type `R`.  Well!  That's interesting! The array to which the function will be applied is full of objects of type `T`!  The function can be applied to the elements of the array.

Finally, there is ++map++'s return.  It is a `List<R>`, a list
whose elements are of type `R`.  An `R` is what you get if you
apply `transform` to an elements of the array (a `T` ).

It all works out.  Calling `map` on an array with a function
that can be applied to the elements of the array will
return a new `List` that contains the results of the
application of the function to each of the elements in the
array.

Here's an example that returns a list of starting dates for
employee records that have those starting dates stored as
strings:

[source,kotlin]
----
data class Hire(
    val name: String,
    val position: String,
    val startDate: String
)

fun List<Hire>.getStartDates(): List<Date> {
    val formatter
        = SimpleDateFormat("yyyy-MM-d", Locale.getDefault())
    return map {
        try {
            formatter.parse(it.startDate)
        } catch (e: Exception) {
            Log.d(
                "getStartDates",
                "Unable to format first date. $e")
            Date()
        }
    }
}
----

Perhaps you're wondering: "What happens if the transform function doesn't
return a value?" Ah! But Kotlin functions _always_ have a value!

For example:

[source,kotlin]
----
val doubles: List<Double?> = listOf(1.0, 2.0, 3.0, null, 5.0)
val squares: List<Double?> = doubles.map { it?.pow(2) }
----

In this example, the variable `squares` will be the list [1.0,
4.0, 9.0, null, 25.0]. Because of the conditional operator, `?.`,
in the transform function, the function's value is the
square of its argument, if that argument is not null.  If
the argument is null, however, the function has the value
`null`.

There are several variations on the `map` function in the
Kotlin library.  One of them, `mapNotNull`, addresses situations like this:

[source,kotlin]
----
val doubles: List<Double?> = listOf(1.0, 2.0, 3.0, null, 5.0)
val squares: List<Double?> = doubles.mapNotNull { it?.pow(2) }
----

The value of the variable `squares` in this example is [1.0,
4.0, 9.0, 25.0].

Another variant of `map` is `mapIndexed`. `mapIndexed` also
takes a function as its argument.  Unlike `map`, though,
++mapIndexed++'s functional argument takes an element of the
collection as its second parameter (not its first and only
parameter, as did ++map++'s argument). ++mapIndexed++'s
functional argument takes, as its first parameter, an `Int`.
The `Int` is the ordinal that gives the position  in the
collection of the element that is its second paramter: 0 for
the first element, 1 for the second, and so on.

There are mapping functions for most collection-like
objects. There are even similar functions for ++Map++s
(though they are not subtypes of `Collection`): the functions
`Map::mapKeys` and `Map::mapValues`.

==== flatMap

The thing that makes the `flatMap` function hard to understand
is that it may seem abstract and not particularly useful.
It turns out that, although it is abstract, it is quite
useful.

Let's start with an analogy. Suppose you decide to reach
out to the members of your old high school debate team. You
don't know how to get in touch anymore. You do remember,
though, that you have yearbooks for all four years you
were in the school and that each yearbook has a picture of
the debate team.

You decide to divide the process of contacting members into
two steps. First you will examine each photo of the
team and try to identify each person depicted there.
You will make a list of the people you identify. You will
then combine the four lists into a single list of all
debate-team members.

That's flatmapping! It's all about containers. Let's
generalize.

Suppose you have some kind of container of something. It is a `CON<T>`. In the yearbook example, `CON<T>` was four
photographs, a `Set<Photo>`. Next you have a function that
maps `T -> KON<R>`. That is, it takes an element of `CON` and
turns it into a new kind of container, a `KON`, whose elements
are of type `R`. In the example, this was you identifying
each person in one of the photos, and producing a
list of names of people in the photo. `KON` is a paper list
and `R` is the name of a person.

The result of the `flatMap` function in the example is the
consolidated list of names.

The flatmap on `CON<T>` is the function:

[source,kotlin]
----
fun <T, R> CON<T>.flatMap(transform: (T) -> KON<R>): KON<R>
----

Note, just for comparison, how `flatMap` is different from
`map`. The `map` function, for the container `CON`, using
the same transform function, has a signature like this:

[source,kotlin]
----
fun <T, R> CON<T>.map(transform: (T) -> KON<R>): CON<KON<R>>
----

The `flatMap` function "flattens" away one of the
containers.

While we're on the subject, let's take a look at an example
of the use of `flatMap` that is very common:

[source,kotlin]
----
val list: List<List<Int>> = listOf(listOf(1, 2, 3, 4), listOf(5, 6))
val flatList: List<Int> = list.flatMap { it }
----

The variable `flatList` will have the value [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6].

This example can be confusing. Unlike the previous example,
which converted a set of photographs to lists of names and then
consolidated those lists, in this common example the two
container types `CON` and `KON` are the same: they are `List<Int>`.
That can make it difficult to see what's actually going on.

Just to prove that it works, though, let's go through the
exercise of binding the quantities in this somewhat baffling
example to the types in the function description. The
function is applied to a `List<List<Int>>`, so `T` must be a
`List<Int>`. The transform function is the identity function.
In other words, it is `(List<Int>) -> List<Int>`: it returns
its parameter.  This means that `KON<R>` must also be a
`List<Int>` and `R` must be an `Int`. The `flatMap` function,
then, will return a `KON<R`>, a `List<Int>`.

It works.

==== Grouping

In addition to filtering, the Kotlin Standard Library provides another
small set of transformation extension functions that group elements of
a collection. The signature for the `groupBy` function, for instance,
looks like this:

[source,kotlin]
----
inline fun <T, K> Array<out T>
    .groupBy(keySelector: (T) -> K): Map<K, List<T>>
----

As is often the case, you can intuit this function's
behavior just by looking at the type information.  `groupBy`
is a function that takes an `Array` of things (`Array` in
this case: there are equivalents for other container types).
For each of the things, it applies the `keySelector` method.
That method, somehow, labels the thing with a value of type
`K`. The return from the `groupBy` method is a map of each of those
labels to a list of the things to which the `keySelector`
assigned that label.

An example will help:
[source,kotlin]
----
val numbers = listOf(1, 20, 18, 37, 2)
val groupedNumbers = numbers.groupBy {
    when {
        it < 20 -> "less than 20"
        else -> "greater than or equal to 20"
    }
}
----

The variable `groupedNumbers` now contains a `Map<String, List<Int>>`.
The map has two keys, "less than 20" and "greater than or equal to
20." The value for the first key is the list [1, 18, 2].  The value
for the second is [20, 37].

Maps that are generated from grouping functions will
preserve  the order of the elements in the original
collection, in the lists that are the values of the keys of
the output map.

==== Iterators Versus Sequences

Suppose you are going to paint your desk.  You decide that it will
look much nicer if it is a nice shade of brown instead of that
generic tan. You head down to the paint store and discover that there
are around 57 colors that might be just the thing.

What you do next? Do you buy samples of each of the colors to
take home? Almost certainly not! Instead, you buy samples of two or three that seem promising and try them. If they turn out not to be
all your heart desires, you go back to the store and buy three more.
Instead of buying samples of all the candidate colors and iterating over
them, you create a process that will let you get the next candidate
colors, given the ones you have already tried.

A sequence differs from an iterator in a similar way. An iterator is
a way of getting each element from an existing collection exactly
once. The collection exists. All the iterator needs to do is order
it.

A sequence, on the other hand, is not necessarily backed by a
collection. Sequences are backed by _generators_. A generator is a
function that will provide the next item in the sequence. In this
example, if you need more paint samples, you have a way of
getting them: you go back to the store and buy more. You don't have
to buy them all and iterate over them. You just need to buy a couple
because you know how to get more. You can stop when you find the
right color, and with luck, that will happen before you pay for
samples of all of the possible colors.

In Kotlin, you might express your search for desk paint like this:

[source,kotlin]
----
val deskColor = generateSequence("burnt umber") {
    buyAnotherPaintSample(it)
}.first { looksGreat(it) }

println("Start painting with ${deskColor}!")
----

This algorithm is efficient.  On average, desk painters using it
will buy only 28 paint samples instead of 57.

Because sequences are lazy—only generating the next element when it
is needed—they can be very, very useful in optimizing operations,
even on collections with fixed content. Suppose, for instance, that
you have a list of URLs, and you want to know which one is a link to a
page that contains an image of a cat. You might do it like this:

[source,kotlin]
----
val catPage = listOf(
    "http://ragdollies.com", 
    "http://dogs.com", 
    "http://moredogs.com")
    .map { fetchPage(it) }
    .first { hasCat(it) }
----

That algorithm will download all of the pages. If you do the same thing
using a [.keep-together]#sequence:#

[source,kotlin]
----
val catPage = sequenceOf(
    "http://ragdollies.com", 
    "http://dogs.com", 
    "http://moredogs.com")
    .map { fetchPage(it) }
    .first { hasCat(it) }
----

only the first page will be downloaded. The sequence will provide the
first URL, the `map` function will fetch it, and the `first` function
will be satisfied. None of the other pages will be downloaded.

Be careful, though! Don't ask for all of the elements of an infinite
collection! This code, for instance, will eventually produce an
`OutOfMemory` error:

[source,kotlin]
----
val nums = generateSequence(1) { it + 1 }
    .map { it * 7 }                 // that's fine
    .filter { it mod 10000 = 0 }    // still ok
    .asList()                       // FAIL!
----

=== An Example

Let's make all this concrete with an example.

We just met several of the handy functions that Kotlin's Standard
Library provides for manipulating collections. Using those
functions, you can create robust implementations of complex logic. To
illustrate that, we'll take an example inspired by a real
application used in an aircraft engine factory.

==== The Problem

Bandalorium Inc. builds aircraft engines. Each engine part is
uniquely identifiable by its serial number. Each part goes
through a rigorous quality control process that records
numerical measurements for several of the part's critical
attributes.

An attribute for an engine part is any measurable feature.
For example, the outside diameter of a tube might be an
attribute. The electrical resistance of some wire might be
another. A third might be a part's ability to reflect a
certain color of light.  The only requirement is that
measuring the attribute must produce a single numerical
value.

One of the things that Bandalorium wants to track is the
precision of its production process. It needs to track
the measurements of the parts it produces and whether
they change over time.

The challenge, then, is:

Given a list of measurements for attributes of parts produced
during a certain interval (say, three months), create a CSV (comma-separated value) report similar to the one
shown in <<output_csv_id>>.  As shown,
the report should be sorted by the time that the measurement
was taken.

[[output_csv_id]]
.Example of CSV ouput.

If we might make a suggestion—now would be a great time to put
this book aside for a moment and consider how you would
approach this problem. Maybe just sketch enough high-level
code to feel confident that you can solve it.

==== The Implementation

In Kotlin, we might represent an attribute like this:

[source,kotlin]
----
data class Attr(val name: String, val tolerance: Tolerance)

enum class Tolerance {
    CRITICAL,
    IMPORTANT,
    REGULAR
}
----

The name is a unique identifier for the attribute. An
attribute's tolerance indicates the significance of the
attribute to the quality of the final product: critical,
important, or just regular.

Each attribute probably has lots of other associated information.
There is, surely, a record of the units of measurement
(centimeters, joules, etc.), a description of its acceptable
values, and perhaps the procedure used to measure it. We
will ignore those features for this example.

[role="pagebreak-before"]
A measurement of an attribute for a specific engine part includes the following:

* The serial number of the part being measured
* A timestamp giving the time at which the measurement was made
* The measured value

A measurement, then, might be modeled in Kotlin like this:

[source,kotlin]
----
data class Point(
    val serial: String,
    val date: LocalDateTime,
    val value: Double)
----

Finally, we need a way to connect a measurement to the
attribute it measures.  We model the relationship like this:

[source,kotlin]
----
data class TimeSeries(val points: List<Point>, val attr: Attr)
----

The `TimeSeries` relates a list of measurements to the ++Attr++s
that they measure.

First, we build the header of the CSV file: the column titles that comprise the first line (see <<making_header_id>>). The first two columns are named `date` and `serial`. The other column names are
the distinct names of the attributes in the dataset.


[[making_header_id]]
.Making the header
====
[source,kotlin]
----
fun createCsv(timeSeries: List<TimeSeries>): String {
    val distinctAttrs = timeSeries
        .distinctBy { it.attr } // <1>
        .map { it.attr }        // <2>
        .sortedBy { it.name }   // <3>

    val csvHeader = "date;serial;" + 
        distinctAttrs.joinToString(";") { it.name } + 
        "\n"

    /* Code removed for brevity */
}
----
====
<1> Use the `distinctBy` function to get a list of
`TimeSeries` instances that have distinct values for the `attr` attribute.

<2> We have a list of distinct `TimeSeries` from the previous step and we only want the `attr`, so we use the `map` function.

<3> Finally, we sort alphabetically using `sortedBy`. It wasn't
required but why not?

Now that we have the list of distinct characteristics, formatting the
header is straightforward using the `joinToString` function. This
function transforms a list into a string by specifying a
string separator to insert between each element of the list. You can
even specify a prefix and/or a postfix if you need to.

[NOTE]
====
It is often useful to be able to find the types of the returns
from collection transformation functions. In
<<making_header_id>>, for instance, if you activate type hints,
you'll only get the inferred type of the whole chain (the type of
the variable `distinctAttrs`). There is a nice
IntelliJ/Android Studio feature that can help!

. Hit Ctrl &#43; Shift &#43; P. You'll see a drop-down window appear.

====

After building the header, we build the content of the CSV file. This is
the most technical and interesting part.

The rest of the CSV file that we are trying to reproduce
sorts the data by date. For each given date, it gives a
part's serial number and then that part's measurement for
each attribute of interest. That's going to take
some thought because, in the model we've created, those
things are not directly related. A `TimeSeries` contains
only data for a single attribute and we will need data for
multiple attributes.

A common approach in this situation is to merge and flatten
the input data into a more convenient data structure, as shown in <<flattenex>>.

[[flattenex]]
.Merge and flatten the data
[source,kotlin]
====
----
fun createCsv(timeSeries: List<TimeSeries>): String {
    /* Code removed for brevity */

    data class PointWithAttr(val point: Point, val attr: Attr)
    
    // First merge and flatten so we can work with a list of PointWithAttr
    val pointsWithAttrs = timeSeries.flatMap { ts ->
        ts.points.map { point -> PointWithAttr(point, ts.attr) }
        
   /* Code removed for brevity */
}
----
====

In this step, we associate each `Point` with its corresponding
`Attr`, in a single [.keep-together]#`PointAndAttr`# object. This is much like
joining two tables in SQL.

The `flatMap` function transforms a list of `TimeSeries`
objects. Internally, the function applied by `flatMap` uses
the `map` function, `series.points.map { ... }`, to create a
list of ++PointAndAttr++s for each point in the `TimeSeries`.
If we had used `map` instead of `flatMap`, we would have produced
a `List<List<PointAndAttr>>`. Remember, though, that `flatMap`
flattens out the top layer of the container, so the result
here is a [.keep-together]#`List<PointAndAttr>`.#

Now that we have "spread" the attribute information into every `Point`,
creating the CSV file is fairly straightforward.

We'll group the list of `pointWithAttrs` by date to create a
`Map<LocalDate, List<PointWithAttr>`. This map will contain
a list of `pointWithAttrs` for each date. Since the example
seems to have a secondary sort (by the part's serial number), we'll
have to group each of the lists in the previously grouped
`Map` by serial number. The rest is just string formatting, as shown in <<datarows>>.

[[datarows]]
.Create data rows
[source,kotlin]
====
----
fun createCsv(timeSeries: List<TimeSeries>): String {
    /* Code removed for brevity */

    val rows = importantPointsWithAttrs.groupBy { it.point.date }  // <1>
    .toSortedMap()                                     // <2>
    .map { (date, ptsWithAttrs1) -> 
        ptsWithAttrs1
            .groupBy { it.point.serial }             // <3>
            .map { (serial, ptsWithAttrs2) ->
                listOf(                                        // <4>
                    date.format(DateTimeFormatter.ISO_LOCAL_DATE),
                    serial
                ) + distinctAttrs.map { attr ->
                    val value = ptsWithAttrs2.firstOrNull { it.attr == attr }
                    value?.point?.value?.toString() ?: ""
                }
            }.joinToString(separator = "") {        // <5>
                it.joinToString(separator = ";", postfix = "\n")
            }
    }.joinToString(separator = "")


    return csvHeader + rows                               // <6>
}
----
====

<1> Group by date, using the `groupBy` function.
<2> Sort the map (by date). It's not mandatory, but a sorted CSV is easier to read.
<3> Group by serial number.
<4> Build the list of values for each line.
<5> Format each line and assemble all those lines using the `joinToString` function.
<6> Finally, return the header and the rows as a single `String`.

Now, let's suppose that you get an additional request to
report only on attributes that are `CRITICAL` or
`IMPORTANT`. You just have to use the `filter` function, as shown in <<filter>>.

[[filter]]
.Filter critical and important samples
[source,kotlin]
====
----
fun createCsv(timeSeries: List<TimeSeries>): String {
    /* Code removed for brevity */

    val pointsWithAttrs2 = timeSeries.filter {
        it.attr.tolerance == Tolerance.CRITICAL
                || it.attr.tolerance == Tolerance.IMPORTANT
    }.map { series ->
        series.points.map { point ->
            PointWithAttr(point, series.attr)
        }
    }.flatten()

    /* Code removed for brevity */

    return csvHeader + rows
}
----
====


That's it!

To test that code, we can use a predefined input and check
that the output matches your expectations. We won't show a full-blown
set of unit tests here—just an example of CSV output, as shown in <<demonstrates>>.

Using functional programming to transform data, as in
this example, is particularly robust. Why? By combining
Kotlin's null safety and functions from the Standard
Library, you can produce code which has either few or no
side effects. Throw in any list of `PointWithAttr` you can
imagine. If even one `Point` instance has a `null` value, the
code won't even compile. Anytime the result of transformation
returns a result which can be null, the language forces you
to account for that scenario.  Here we did this in 
step 4, with the `firstOrNull` function.

It's always a thrill when your code compiles and does
exactly what you expect it to do on the first try. With
Kotlin's null safety and functional programming, that
happens [.keep-together]#a lot.#

=== Summary

As a functional language, Kotlin employs great ideas
like mapping, zipping, and other functional transformations.
 It even allows you to create your own data transformations
with the power of higher-order functions and lambdas:

* Kotlin collections include the entire Java collections API. In
addition, the library provides all the common functional transformations like
mapping, filtering, grouping, and more.

* Kotlin supports inline functions for more performant
data transformations.

* The Kotlin collections library supports sequences, a way of working with
collections that are defined by intention instead of extension.
Sequences are appropriate when getting the next element is
very expensive, or even on collections of unbounded size.

If you've ever used languages like Ruby, Scala, or Python,
perhaps some of this feels familiar to you. It should!
Kotlin's design is based on many of the same principles
that drove the development of those languages.

Writing your Android code in a more functional way is as
easy as using data transformation operations offered with
the Kotlin Standard Library. Now that you are familiar
with Kotlin syntax and the spirit of functional programming
in Kotlin, the next chapter focuses on the Android OS
and other programming fundamentals. Android development
turned toward Kotlin as an official language back in 2017,
so Kotlin has heavily influenced Android's evolution in recent years. It will continue to do so in the coming
years.
